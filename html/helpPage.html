<h3>
	Create Design
</h3>
<p>
	<ul type='disc'>
		<li>
			Drag and drop "Layout Container" or "Node" from the left palette to the design board.
			<ul type='disc'>
				<li>
					"Layout Container" cannot overlap with other containers or nodes upon drop. If overlaps,<br>it will either automatically apply shift to avoid any overlap, or fails to add container in some cases.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Drag and drop a "Node" into a "Layout Container" on the design board.
			<ul type='disc'>
				<li>
					"Layout Container" automatically does layout of its nodes inside.
				</li>
				<li>
					Nodes can be moved out from its container or moved to another container.
				</li>
				<li>
					"Layout Container" is just a container. Design can be done without any "Layout Container".
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Drag "Layout Container" to move all nodes inside.
			<ul type='disc'>
				<li>
					If the container is dropped on other containers or nodes,<br>the container along with inside nodes will go back to original position.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Connect nodes by dragging ports of nodes.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>
	Configure Design
</h3>
<p>
	<ul type='disc'>
		<li>
			Local configuration: click any connection. The connection will be highlighted.
			<br>Weight and label of this connection will be shown and can be changed in the local configuration panel.
		</li>
		<li>
			Global configuration: click "Global" tab in the configuration panel.
		</li>
		<li>
			Drag "Zoom" on the design tool bar to zoom in/out.
		</li>
		<li>
			Select "Style" on the design tool bar to change connection style.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>
	Save Design
</h3>
<p>
	Click "Save" button on the right side of design tool bar.
	<ul type='disc'>
		<li>
			If not logged in, a window will be shown asking login or signup.
		</li>
		<li>
			If design is new, a window will be shown asking for design title.
		</li>
		<li>
			If design is based on saved design, it will be saved with the same title but with incremented version number.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>
	Load Design
</h3>
<p>
	Click "Designs" tab on the top of the page. Click "Edit Design" button to load design.
	<ul type='disc'>
		<li>
			User needs to log in to retrieve designs.
		</li>
		<li>
			If user is logged in and has unsaved changes, a window will be shown asking if save design first.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>
	Export Design to PNG file
</h3>
<p>
	Click "Actions" menu on the design tool bar, and select "Export to PNG".
	<ul type='disc'>
		<li>
			A new window/tab will be opened showing the PNG of the design.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>
	Create New Empty Design
</h3>
<p>
	Click "New Design" button on the design tool bar.
	<ul type='disc'>
		<li>
			If user is logged in and has unsaved changes, a window will be shown asking if save design first.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>
